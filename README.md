# swift_calc

A simple calculator app for iOS 8.1, implemented in Swift.<br>
I use this small project to experiment with the Swift language and get to know the Xcode environment.

The app is inspired by the 2015 [Stanford Course on Swift](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-8-apps-swift/id961180099). I followed the course and build my own swift_calc from scratch, using a slighly different appraoch than the Stanford course.
